# Nixpacks configuration for Railway deployment
# This file ensures pnpm is used for all services
# Railway will use service-specific nixpacks.toml files if they exist
#
# IMPORTANT: This monorepo uses pnpm workspaces with "workspace:*" protocol.
# npm cannot install workspace:* dependencies - only pnpm can.
# Railway must use pnpm, not npm, or builds will fail with:
# "npm error Unsupported URL Type 'workspace:' workspace:*"
#
# NOTE: We install pnpm via npm (not corepack) to avoid corepack keyid errors on Railway.
